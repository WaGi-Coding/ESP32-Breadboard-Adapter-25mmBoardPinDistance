# ESP32-Breadboard-Adapter 25mm Board Pin Distance

Breadboard Adapter PCB to better fit an ESP32 DevKit onto your Breadboard. Has a Slot for a LED on GPIO2 and an OLED Screen (128x64).
The Pin Sequence is the same as from the ESP itself, just 2 Ground Pins got removed to save space.

It's designed for the "AZ-Delivery ESP32 DevKit C v4". If you have another Board, check the Pin mid distance, it should be 25mm, also check the Pinout of the mentioned Board.
